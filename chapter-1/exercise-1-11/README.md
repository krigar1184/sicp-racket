## Question

A function f is defined by the following rule:
```
f(n) = n if n < 3,
f(n) = f(n - 1) + 2 * f(n - 2) + 3 * f(n - 3) if n >= 3.
```
Write a procedure that computes f by means of a recursive process.
See [recursive.rkt](./recursive.rkt)

Write a procedure that computes f by means of an iterative process.
See [iterative.rkt](./iterative.rkt)
