## Question

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc,
which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

```racket
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5).
Are these processes iterative or recursive?

## Answer

The first implementation uses linear recursive process, which can be illustrated like this:

```racket
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5)) ; 3 + 5 + 1
(inc (inc (+ 2 5))) ; 2 + 5 + 1 + 1
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5)))) ; 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5))))) ; 0 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
(inc (inc (inc (inc (5))))) ; 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
(inc (inc (inc 6))) ; 6 + 1 + 1 + 1
(inc (inc 7)) ; 7 + 1 + 1
(inc 8); 8 + 1
9
```

The second implementation uses linear iterative process and can be illustrated like this:

```racket
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```
